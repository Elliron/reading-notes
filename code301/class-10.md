## Call Stack
  - mechanism for interpreter
  - tracks spot in script that calls multiple functions
  - tracks function currently run and what is called in it
  - function invocation(call)
  - one at a time, top to bottom, synchronous
  - vital to asynchronous programming
  - last in, first out principle to temp store and manage invocation(call)

### stack overflow
  - recursive function(calls itself) without exit point.

## JS errors
  - reference
  - syntax
  - range
  - type
