## CSS Grid

CSS Grids are a layout system that is 2-dimensional (while Flexbox is 1-dimensional). Grid was developed to solve layout problems that developers have been "hacking" (floats, positioning, etc) their way around. It allows the user to use a row (grid-row) and column (grid-column) to position objects.  You apply the rules to both the parent(container) element and the it's children(item).
