### About
Hi everyone, my name is Glenn Elliron Clark and I go by he/him.  I am a former Marine and Ballroom Dance Instructor, my favorite dances are Viennese Waltz and West Coast Swing.  I started coding around a year ago on Code Academy and Tree House but this is my first real coding course.  I was inspired to take up coding by a friend from college who had graduated from Code Fellows a few years ago.   She went from working in a bank to working for an app, the work life balance difference was apparent.  I enjoy traveling, taking classes and learning new skills.  I am really loving how positive and helpful the coding community is and look forward to collaborating with everyone.  [My Github Profile](https://github.com/Elliron)
