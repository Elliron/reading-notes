## Names and Values in Python
  - Python is a simple language
    - Names refer to values
    - Multiple names for a single value
    - reassigned independently
    - values live until no references
    - assignment never copies data
    - changes visible through all names
    - mutable aliasing
    - immutable values cant alias
    - references can be more than names
    - any name can refere to any value
    - names have no type, values have no scope
