# 401 Class-02 Testing and Modules

## In Tests We Trust

- TDD - test driven development
- Unit Tests - piece of code to exercise input, output and behavior.

- Test Name - descriptive, expected result and what is testing.

- Test File Name - follow module name

``` mymodule/  module.py ```

 - Arrange - organize data to execute piece of code (input)
 - Act - execute test code
 - Assert - check the result (output)

 - Cycle - 3 steps
   - Write a unit test and make it fail
   - Write a feature and make it pass
   - Refactor the code


## Recursion

  - Recursion - function calls itself directly or indirectly

  - Recursive function - corresponding function 

```
f(n) = 1                  n=1

f(n) = n + f(n-1)    n>1

function “ f( ) ” itself is being called inside the function
```
  - Direct recursive - function calls same function
  - Indirect recursive - functions calls another function which calls the latter function directly or indirectly

  - Tail recursive - recursive call is last thing executed by function
